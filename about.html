 <h1>Hi, I’m Ennis Ogidan.</h1> 

<div class="container">
<h3>EARLY LIFE</h3>
<p1>
<p>Born and raised in Clapham, South West London, to Nigerian parents, I attended St Mary’s RC Primary school from 2003 to 2011. It was at St Mary’s where I discovered my love for the beautiful game, football.
By the time I got to 11 years there had been a lot of changes in my life. I moved from Clapham to Norbury, I was transitioning into the next stage of my education (secondary school) at St Joseph’s College, and I started making money for myself on a consistent basis (more on that later). </p>
<p>St Joseph’s made me. I discovered the world of anime and manga, picked up a completely new sport in the form of basketball and realised my passion for technology and the digital world all during my 6 years at the school. St Joseph's is also where I learnt to grind, hustle and make something out of nothing through my cookie resell business. As soon as I got to secondary school I realised that I couldn't rely on people for money and that I'd need to learn how to make my own. This led me to have a genius plan. Every morning I would buy multiple packs of Sainsbury's bakery cookies at a price of £1 for a 5 pack. At school, I would then resell each cookie for 50p resulting in a profit of £1.50 per pack. This business I had taught me ‘the value of money’ and made me realise what my parents meant when they said, “money doesn’t grow on trees”. </p>
</p1>


<h3>AMBITIONS</h3>
<p2>
I am an aspiring… <br>
I have a lot of skills that I'd like to learn and utilize. Some of these include: 
<ul>
- UI/UX design; <br>
- full-stack web development; <br>
- mobile development; <br>
- search engine optimization; <br>
- working with several tools used for digital marketing like Google AdWords and the Google Webmasters tools.
</ul> 
My end goal is to build my own digital empire and I feel like these skills are essential to success in the online world.
</p2>


<h3>PRESENT PROJECTS AND PLANS</h3>
<p3>
<p>I am currently pursuing a level 3 apprenticeship in digital marketing. “Why aren't you doing levels?” I hear you ask. The thing is, I just finished my first year of A levels and I could tell it wasn't the right route for me for several reasons: none of the skills I need to achieve my future goals we're taught in school; the style of teaching was very static (memorise a 2 year course for a one hour and a half long paper); and I felt like there was always a ‘right answer’ which goes against my ideal of individualism. </p>
I am at the start of my journey to my dream and as such, I lack a lot of key skills needed to achieve it. However, I am enthusiastic to learn. I have already taught myself HTML and CSS and with those languages, I built this portfolio website. I also taught myself how to use vb.net as a coding language to learn how to efficiently program and problem solve. I am currently trying to learn digital marketing techniques like search engine optimisation and how to use AdWords to secure and prosper during my apprenticeship.
